# radiator: an R package for RADseq Data Exploration, Manipulation and Visualization

Most genomic analysis look for patterns and trends with various
statistics. Bias, noise and outliers can have bounded influence on
estimators and interfere with polymorphism discovery. Avoid bad data
exploration and control the impact of filters on your downstream genetic
analysis. Use radiator to: import, explore, manipulate, visualize,
filter, impute and export your GBS/RADseq data.

**radiator** is designed and optimized for fast computations of diploid
data using Genomic Data Structure
[GDS](https://github.com/zhengxwen/gdsfmt) file format and data science
packages in [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org). **radiator** handles
VCF files with millions of SNPs and files of several GB.

## Installation

To try out the dev version of **radiator**, copy/paste the code below:

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/radiator")
library(radiator)
```

**Note**

Some Windows OS and Linux OS recently experienced some problems during
installations, linked to CRAN & Bioconductor tango problems:

- If you’re experiencing problems with radiator installation see
  [troubleshooting
  section](https://thierrygosselin.github.io/radiator/articles/rad_genomics_computer_setup.html)
  and try the lines below.

- Verify that installing **radiator** also installed the
  [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SeqArray.html)
  packages: `gdsfmt` and
  [SeqArray](https://github.com/zhengxwen/SeqArray) with version \>=
  1.28.1.

``` r
devtools::package_info(pkgs = "SeqArray") # to verify version

# If manually installing SeqArray is necessary
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("SeqArray")
```

## [Life cycle](https://thierrygosselin.github.io/radiator/articles/life_cycle.html)

radiator is maturing, but in order to make the package better, changes
are inevitable. Experimental functions will change, argument names will
change. Your codes and workflows might break from time to time until
radiator is stable. Consequently, depending on your tolerance to change,
radiator might not be for you. Avoid using radiator if you suffer from
the Semmelweis reflex. Philosophy, major changes and deprecated
functions/arguments are documented in life cycle section of functions.

- The latest changes are documented
  ([here](https://thierrygosselin.github.io/radiator/articles/life_cycle.html))
  and in [changelog, versions, new features and bug
  history](https://thierrygosselin.github.io/radiator/news/index.html)
