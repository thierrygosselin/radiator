## Contributions:
  
  This package has been developed in the open, and it wouldn’t be nearly as good without your contributions. There are a number of ways you can help me make this package even better:
  
  * If you don’t understand something, please let me know. 
* Your feedback on what is confusing or hard to understand is valuable. 
* If you spot a typo, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull request.

New to pull request on github ? The process is very easy:
  
  * Click the edit this page on the sidebar.
* Make the changes using github’s in-page editor and save.
* Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes. 
* “Fixing typos” is perfectly adequate.
