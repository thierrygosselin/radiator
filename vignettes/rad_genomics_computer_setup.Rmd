**Time to allow: ETA ~30-45 min for experience users, 1h-2h for novices**

This vignette purposes is to show users how to setup their computers 
for RADseq genomic analysis inside R. It targets users of my packages or 
workshops. 

The vignette as an `Installation problems` section, browse through it if your experiencing 
installation issues.

The vignette is also usefull if your:

* conducting imputations
* using simulations with `grur` and it's dependencies or simulations with `strataG`. 
* specific installation instructions for:
* `rmetasim`
* `XGBoost`
* `LightGBM`
* `randomForestSRC`
* `ranger`
* `missRanger`
* `pcaMethods`
* how to have **OpenMP enabled** specific packages. R packages that requires 
to run in parallel for the imputations (e.g. `fstcore`, `fst`, `data.table`).

I'm currently merging information also found in this [tutorial](http://gbs-cloud-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03_computer_setup.html)



# macOS

**Warning: package management software *Homebrew* and/or *MacPorts* :**

My experience with these packages is that at some point they will be unreliable with 
genomic software installation. It might do the trick for some software,
but eventually you will lose a lot of time trying to figure out what's your problem.

In this vignette I present *brewless* options only. 

## Update your OS

* the current version is macOS Sequoia 15.1
* [how to update](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1338?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)


## Get administrator and root user access

Make sure you have administrator and root user access to your computer [how](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204012).



## Apple's Command Line Tools

Make sure it's installed...if not, follow instructions. 
Although the prompt message may be a bit confusing, just click **install**.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
xcode-select --install
```


**Notes:**

* If command line tools is already installed you'll get this message 
`xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates`
* to test if you have a compiler, you can also type: `make` in the terminal, if it's installed you will have something similar to this `*** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.`

**Terminology:**

* [Reading](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/the-magic-behind-configure-make-make-install): 
to understand the basic steps to install software with the terminal 
(*configure*, *make* and *sudo make install* steps)
* `./configure`: configure everything before installation
* `make`: connect libraries and the source before make install 
([doc](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html))
* `make install`: use to build (compile) source code to create binary files and
install the application on our system as configured using `./configure`,
usually in `/usr/local/bin`.


## Compiler
Apple can't ship GNU [Compiler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) 
Collection (GCC) with OpenMP enabled,
similar story with [Clang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang) 
the other compiler used in macOS. Consequently,
both need to be updated manually if you want to run software and packages 
that uses parallel computing (stacks, data.table, etc).

The command below fro both GCC and Clang will:

* change directory to your downloads
* download the compiler's binaries 
* uncompress and move folders (`bin`, `include`, `lib`, `libexec` and `share`) of the compiler on your computer `/usr/local` directory.
* remove the downloaded file
* check the version of gcc

### Update GCC

Choose the binary version number based on your OS and change the version accordingly [link](http://hpc.sourceforge.net).

```

### Update Clang

We want [clang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang) compiler with OpenMP enabled. The latest version is [19.1.3](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-19.1.3).

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#In browser make sure you know if your mac as an Intel or Mac chips (M1, M2, etc)
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-19.1.3/LLVM-19.1.3-macOS-X64.tar.xz
#In Terminal
cd Downloads
sudo tar -xzvf LLVM-19.1.3-macOS-X64.tar.xz -C/usr/local --strip-components=1
```


```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo rm LLVM-19.1.3-macOS-X64.tar.xz
clang -v
```

## PATH

The shell start up script and PATH to programs**

To make things a little easier to talk to your computer, each time you open the
*Terminal* a [shell start up scripts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) tells your
computer where to look for programs. The path for your programs can be modified
in your shell start up script. When your computer is searching for programs, it
looks into these [path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)):

```{bash eval=FALSE}
$PATH
```

The output should look like this:
`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin`.
But sometimes, it will also say: `No such file or directory` (no worries, see below).

Use the `pwd` command to know exactly where you are!

The name of the shell startup file differs across platforms. Depending on OS it
is called **~/.bash_profile** and sometimes **~/.profile**. Filename beginning
with a dot "." are reserved for the system and are **invisible** in the mac Finder.
 
Find your shell start up script with the following command:
 
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls -al ~ | grep profile
```
 
If this returns nothing (blank), you don't have a shell start up script. Create
one with this command

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo touch $HOME/.bash_profile
```

To modify, you can use [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html)
to open or make and modify hidden items (using the option *Show hidden items* on the open file screen).
Look for the free version.
With Linux, use Vi!

Copy/paste the line below in your `.bash_profile` file:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin"
```

After modifying your shell start up script always run the command `source ~/.bash_profile` to reload it.


## Useful tools

Below are useful but not essential software you will like to have on your mac.


### [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html)

This is TextWrangler replacement and is a free text editor that will help you save time. Once
installed, go in the `Apple Menu bar -> BBEdit -> Install Command Line`

### [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) 

This is a Python installer tool that I highly recommend.
To install or upgrade pip, securely download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).

Run this from you Terminal:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~/Downloads
sudo python get-pip.py
```

If you get *command not found* you might not have python installed.


```{bash eval=FALSE}
pip install -U pip   # to upgrade
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo rm -R ~/Downloads/get-pip.py # to remove the downloaded file
```

# Linux

Make sure you have GCC and CLANG with OpenMP enabled.
Several flavors available, check for the proper [link](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

# Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org)

To install R v4.4.2 **"Pile of Leaves"** released on 2024-10-31 download the
installer and follow the instructions
```{bash eval=FALSE}
# for macOS
cd Downloads
curl -O https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-4.4.2.pkg
```




**To remove R completely from macOS**
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework /Applications/R.app \
/usr/bin/R /usr/bin/Rscript
```

# Rstudio

To download RStudio, check this [link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
and download the installer for your OS.

# Installing Libraries

Below is how I setup most of my computers after a clean macOS install.
1. Start with **devtools** and **tidyverse**

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


2. The gsl package is required by numerous packages and can cause some headaches...
Don't install it from source.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("gsl")
```


If the console print this: `Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)`. Always aswer **no** unless of course you know what you are doing.

3. Than, I install **grur** and **assigner** my packges with the higher number of dependencies, 
this way it's installing automatically 90%
of the packages I need (including **radiator**).

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/grur")
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/assigner")
```

# Makevars file

For some packages you might have to compile from source and 
the use of different compiler is sometimes very useful.
You need to tell R how to use the compilers. 
This might change from one package
to another. Nothing is simple, you know this by now...
All this is done through R's **Makevars** file located in `~/.R/Makevars`.

To modify or create the file, the fastest way is to use the package [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org) (it's installed automatically with `devtools`):
```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_makevars()
```

**Makevars content required:**
```{bash eval=FALSE}
CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc
CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++
FC=/usr/local/bin/gfortran
F77=/usr/local/bin/gfortran
PKG_LIBS = -fopenmp -lgomp
PKG_CFLAGS= -O3 -Wall -pipe -pedantic -std=gnu99 -fopenmp
PKG_CXXFLAGS=-fopenmp -std=c++11
CFLAGS= -O3 -Wall -pipe -pedantic -std=gnu99 -fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS = -fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS = -fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_FCFLAGS = -fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS = -fopenmp
# change the nex line according to your computer compiler version (use gcc -v in terminal):
FLIBS=-L/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin19/9.2.0/finclude 
CFLAGS=-mtune=native -g -O2 -Wall -pedantic -Wconversion
CXXFLAGS=-mtune=native -g -O2 -Wall -pedantic -Wconversion
```


# Errors and installation problems {#Installation_problems}

Sometimes you'll get warnings while installing dependencies required for 
*x* package.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Warning: cannot remove prior installation of package ‘stringi’
```
To solve this problem, delete manually the problematic package in the installation folder (on mac: `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library`) or in the `Terminal`:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo rm -R /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/package_name
# Changing 'package_name' to the problematic package.
# Reinstall the package.
```

* Using the latest version of R, RStudio and packages is recommended. If your heart
start pounding just at the thought of having to install a new R version, you should
have a look at [packrat](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/managing-package-dependencies-in-r-with-packrat/).

* Look at the output in R console when you get an error message. If it's related to
one's of the packages dependencies, try installing it separately before attempting
to reinstall the problematic package.

## Error: macOS Big Sur update

So far, I've only experience 1 problem after upgrading to Big Sur, and it's linked
to *adegenet* dependency on [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package [(solution)](#sfprob).


## Error: checking whether the C++ compiler works... no

When rtying to compile a software if you get this error: `checking whether the C++ compiler works... no` or `configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables`

Try installing Xcode from the App Store.


## Error: "https" not supported

If you get something like: `https not supported or disabled in libcurl`, install or re-install:

[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org)

Required if GCC compiler is used (TLS backend is then used). Not required if clang is used (securetransport backend is used).
```{bash eval=FALSE}
#In browser
https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1.tar.gz

#In Terminal
cd ~/Downloads
curl -L https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1.tar.gz | tar xf -
cd openssl-1.1.1
./config
make -j12 #change with your number of CPU
make test #long
sudo make install
cd ..
sudo rm -R openssl*
```

[curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download)

Check for the latest release of [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download)
```{bash eval=FALSE}
#Copy/paste in your browser
https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.85.0.tar.gz
# Terminal
cd ~/Downloads
tar -zxvf curl-7.85.0.tar.gz
cd curl-7.85.0
```

*for more *curl* option type `curl -h`*



The next step depends on the compiler used

With **gcc**:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
./configure --with-ssl # to enable https via OpenSSL and using GCC
```
Note: with macOS 11.0.1 this give me an error `configure: error: OpenSSL libs and/or directories were not found where specified!`

If this is the case, use **clang**:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
CC="/usr/local/bin/clang"
./configure --without-ssl #--with-darwinssl # to install via clang
```


```{bash eval=FALSE}
make -j12 #change with your number of CPU
sudo make install
cd ..
sudo rm -R curl*
```

## Linux related problem

If you have an install problem, the problem might be very computer-specific. 
e.g. if the problem is related to `strataG`, `copula` and/or `gsl`, try
installing `libgsl0-dev` in the **Terminal** (very easy now with the latest RStudio release!):

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
```


## Error: `vector memory exhausted` {#Renviron}

For errors that highlight problems with vectors and memory similar to: 
`vector memory exhausted (limit reached)`. 
In R, verify that you have a file called `~/.Renviron`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
file.exists("~/.Renviron")
```

If you don't have the file:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
require(usethis)
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Add this to your `.Renviron` file located in `~/.Renviron`:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
R_MAX_VSIZE = 100Gb 
```

You can also use a text editor that allows you to see hidden files (files starting with a `.` *dot*).

## Error during package installation

* Problem with `string.h`, `math.h` or any other `.h`
* Problem with `vroom`
* Problem with `rmetasim`

An example during `vroom` installation:

```{bash vroom problem, eval=FALSE}
clang++ -std=gnu++11 -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include" -DNDEBUG  -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/Rcpp/include" -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/progress/include" -I/usr/local/include  -Imio/include -DWIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN -Ispdlog/include -fPIC  -Wall -g -O2 -c gen.cc -o gen.o
clang++ -std=gnu++11 -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include" -DNDEBUG  -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/Rcpp/include" -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/progress/include" -I/usr/local/include  -Imio/include -DWIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN -Ispdlog/include -fPIC  -Wall -g -O2 -c index_collection.cc -o index_collection.o
/usr/local/bin/clang -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include" -DNDEBUG  -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/Rcpp/include" -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/progress/include" -I/usr/local/include   -fPIC  -I/usr/local/include -c localtime.c -o localtime.o
localtime.c:42:10: fatal error: 'string.h' file not found
#include <string.h>
^~~~~~~~~~
```

**With macOS** : your `Makevars` needs additional lines to make it work [configuration](#Makevars_config).

## Error `.setMaxGlobalSize`

Its a problem with a previous version of `pbmcapply` and it's interaction with
`future`.

**Solution:**

* restart your computer
* with a clean desk and session: open RStudio and update your packages
* Restart R (`RStudio > Session > Restart R`)
* Re-install my github package generating the error

_Note:_ if your heart
start pounding just at the thought of having to update everything on your computer
you should definitely have a look at [packrat](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/managing-package-dependencies-in-r-with-packrat/): it's very easy to use.

## Error `.DynamicClusterCall`

If you have a PC and you're getting this error or closely related error:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Error in .DynamicClusterCall(cl, length(cl), .fun = function(.proc_idx,  :
# One of the nodes produced an error: Can not open file 'FILE PATH'. The process cannot access the file because it # is being used by another process.
```

**Solution:** Use `parallel.core = 1` in the function generating the error.

## Corrupt packages

The error below usually happens when several packages are updated:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Error in get0(oNam, envir = ns) :
# lazy-load database '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/callr/R/callr.rdb' is corrupt
# In addition: Warning message:
# In get0(oNam, envir = ns) : internal error -3 in R_decompress1
```

**Solution:**

1. restart R
2. re-install the package that generated this error

## Error: `dyn.load` {#Dynload}

I see 2 problems and separate solutions. When the error is related to 
*adegenet*, *strataG*, *assigner* or packages that depends on 
[sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package, [see the solution below](#sfprob).

When the error is similar to:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared object '/home/rstudio/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.6/units/libs/units.so':
  libudunits2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Calls: <Anonymous> ... asNamespace -> loadNamespace -> library.dynam -> dyn.load
Execution halted
```

**Solution:**

1. In R, check the output of this command that look for the [environment variables](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/EnvVar.html):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.getenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH")
# [1]""
```

Note that if the output is not empty, like in the example above, write down the output.

2. Set the new [environment variables](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/EnvVar.html) by adding `/usr/local/lib/` to the output above:

When it's empty:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# in R:
Sys.setenv(LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib/")
# For Linux you could use: /usr/local/lib/:/usr/lib64 
```


When it's not, add at the end, separated by `:`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib64/R/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib64:/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.222.b10-0.amzn2.0.1.x86_64/jre/lib/amd64/server:/usr/local/lib/:/usr/lib64")
```

**Long-term solution:** 

Instead of using `Sys.setenv` each time you have a similar problem,
you could add the [environment variables](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/EnvVar.html) `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to your `.Renviron file`. [This is discussed in another problem above](#Renviron).

## Error related to [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and `dyn.load` {#sfprob}

Sometimes the problem related to [dyn.load problems](#Dynload) originates from 
specific packages. So far, for me,  they are always linked to [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package.
The problem for macOS is usually when updating os, e.g. from Catalina -> Big Sur. 
The solution is similar for [Linux when you try to install adegenet](https://thierrygosselin.github.io/RADseq_cloud_tutorial/radseq_cloud_tutorial.html#install_packages).

There are solutions using *Homebrew*, but I'm not a fan for the shortcuts.

**Back in R/RStudio**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rgeos", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type="source")
install.packages("rgdal", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type="source")
devtools::install_github("r-spatial/sf", configure.args = "--with-proj-lib=/usr/local")
install.packages("adegenet")
```

## Error: `HTTP status was 404 Not Found`

This error is sometimes poping after a new R upgrade. Try installing the problematic package differently.


Instead of: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("SeqArray")
```


Try:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_local(path = "SeqArray_latest.tar.gz")
```


## Error: `C stacks usage`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Error: C stack usage  7971092 is too close to the limit
```

So far, I haven't found the cure to this computer-specific problem.

**Potential solutions:**

- Make sure you have enough RAM on your computer for the dataset you want to analyze (16GB is the bare minimum these days for small-medium RADseq dataset). 
- Closing all windows/app running in the background somtimes help.
- Updating to the latest version of R, RStudio and libraries.
- Not a fan of upgrading to latest version, use [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/).
- Follow the guidelines to prepare your computer in this vignette, from the start...


## Google is your next best friend...

# Specific librairies installation


## `fst` & `fstcore` & `data.table`

Better to install and compile them from source to enable OpenMP. Install in the 
terminal [zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and [lz4](https://lz4.github.io/lz4/):


```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~/Downloads
curl -L https://github.com/lz4/lz4/archive/refs/tags/v1.10.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
cd lz4*
make 
sudo make install
cd .. 
sudo rm -R lz4*
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~/Downloads
curl -L https://github.com/facebook/zstd/archive/refs/tags/v1.5.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
cd zstd*
make 
sudo make install
cd .. 
sudo rm -R zstd*
```


`fstcore`, `fst` and `data.table` requires these R *Makevars* specifications.

## `rmetasim`

### Download
Download the latest github release of Allan Strand's [rmetasim](https://github.com/stranda/rmetasim)
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~/Downloads
curl -L -O https://github.com/stranda/rmetasim/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
```

### Modify the number of loci: MAXLOCI

If you want to use more loci during your simulations (default is 10001),
you need to modify rmetasim before compiling.
With a text editor, modify the `const.h` file in the `src` folder: `rmetasim-master/src/const.h`.
Navigate to **lane 33** and change the integer to the desired maximum number of loci. Or do this in the Terminal:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sed -i -e 's/#define MAXLOCI               10001/#define MAXLOCI               20000/g' rmetasim-master/src/const.h
```

### Makevars configuration {#Makevars_config}
*rmetasim* requires these Makevars  (`~/.R/Makevars` file) specifications. 
If you have other lines, comment (#) before compiling `rmetasim`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_makevars()
```

### Test R-package
You should see a time difference between both runs
```{r eval=FALSE}
require(xgboost)
x <-  matrix(rnorm(100*10000), 10000, 100)
y <-  x %*% rnorm(100) + rnorm(1000)

system.time({bst = xgboost(data = x, label = y, nthread = 1, nround = 100, verbose = FALSE)})
system.time({bst = xgboost(data = x, label = y, nthread = 4, nround = 100, verbose = FALSE)})
```


## `LightGBM`

`LightGBM` requires an OpenMP-enabled compiler. Currently, it doesn't work well with
clang, so make sure you have updated your GCC compiler (instructions above).
Additionally, `LightGBM` requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/overview/)

### Download and install CMake
```{bash eval=FALSE}
#In browser or using curl in Terminal
https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v4.0.0/cmake-4.0.0-macos-universal.dmg
# double-click on the disk image and follow instructions
```


To add CMake to the PATH:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin":"$PATH"
# Or, to install symlinks to '/usr/local/bin', run:
sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install
# Or, to install symlinks to another directory, run:
sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install=/path/to/bin
#Then, run the following commands to install LightGBM:
```

### Download and Install LightGBM
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd Downloads
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM
cd LightGBM
Rscript build_r.R
# previous version required running these lines instead
#cd LightGBM/R-package
#export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++
#R CMD INSTALL --build . --no-multiarch
```



## `randomForestSRC`
[randomForestSRC](http://web.ccs.miami.edu/~hishwaran/ishwaran.html) requires 
the GCC OpenMP-enabled compiler to run in parallel. 
See instructions above if not already done.


### Makevars configuration
Check that the lines below **are not** commented in your `~/.R/Makevars` file:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_makevars()
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc
CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++
CFLAGS=-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic -std=gnu99 -mtune=native -pipe
CXXFLAGS=-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11 -mtune=native -pipe
PKG_CFLAGS= -O3 -Wall -pipe -pedantic -std=gnu99 -fopenmp
PKG_CXXFLAGS=-fopenmp -std=c++11
FC=/usr/local/bin/gfortran
F77=/usr/local/bin/gfortran
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
PKG_LIBS = "-liconv"
```

### Download and install
From the Terminal run these steps to download and compile randomForestSRC:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~/Downloads
curl -L https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/randomForestSRC_2.9.3.tar.gz | tar xf -
cd randomForestSRC
```

Make sure you have autoconf installed:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
# in Terminal
cd ~/Downloads
autoconf
```

Should output: `autoconf: error: no input file`, 
if not, install following the [steps here](#useful).

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# in Terminal
cd ~/Downloads/randomForestSRC
autoconf
cd ~/Downloads
R CMD INSTALL --preclean --clean randomForestSRC
```

You want to make sure that this line is printed during execution of the previous command:
`checking whether OpenMP will work in a package... yes` or `checking for /usr/local/bin/gcc option to support OpenMP... -fopenmp`

## Update [Github](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Github)

macOS comes with [Github](https://github.com), a Version Control System
(VCS), pre-installed. However, the install is in `/usr/bin/git`
which can make it difficult for beginners to update. To change this, run these
commands:

1. Install [GNU Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~/Downloads
curl -L http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-latest.tar.gz | tar xf -
cd autoconf-2.69
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd .. 
sudo rm -R ~/Downloads/autoconf-*
```

2. Install Github

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git --version                   # show current git version installed
which git                       # returns where is git on your computer
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/git/git # install the latest Git
cd git
make configure
./configure
make -j12
sudo make install
cd .. 
sudo rm -R ~/Downloads/git/     # remove git folder
source ~/.bash_profile          # reload startup script
git --version                   # confirmed the version you just installed
which git                       # returns /usr/local/bin
```


## macOS Terminal from specific folder

In **System Preferences** choose `Keyboard -> Shortcuts`. From the left panel, choose
**Services**. In the right panel, under **Files and Folders**, choose **New
Terminal at Folder and/or New Terminal Tab at Folder**. Now you can right-click
your track pad or mouse on a folder and choose Services -> New Terminal at
Folder!

```{r terminal_folder_shortcut.png, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("terminal_folder_shortcut.png")
```

## Shortcut to folder path

With macOS, open the [Automator application](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/automator/welcome/mac). 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
File -> New (cmd-N)
Choose: Services
Left panel, choose: Library -> Utilities
Middle, choose: Copy to Clipboard and drag it to the right panel
Now you want to have: Service receives selected FILES OR FOLDERS in FINDER>
You should have something similar to the image below:
```

```{r copy_path.png, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("copy_path.png")
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
Save (cmd-S) or File -> Save service as: copy path to clipboard
```

Go in the Finder, select a folder and right click on it you should see 'copy path to clipboard' at the bottom or in **Services**.
