\title{Write a vcf file from a tidy data frame}
\usage{
write_vcf(data, pop.info = FALSE, filename = NULL, source = NULL,
  empty = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy data frame object in the global environment or
a tidy data frame in wide or long format in the working directory.
\emph{How to get a tidy data frame ?}
Look into \pkg{radiator} \code{\link{tidy_genomic_data}}.}

\item{pop.info}{(optional, logical) Should the population information be
included in the FORMAT field (along the GT info for each samples ?). To make
the VCF population-ready use \code{pop.info = TRUE}. The population information
must be included in the \code{POP_ID} column of the tidy dataset.
Default: \code{pop.info = FALSE}. Experimental.}

\item{filename}{(optional) The file name prefix for the vcf file
written to the working directory. With default: \code{filename = NULL},
the date and time is appended to \code{radiator_vcf_file_}.}
}
\description{
Write a vcf file (file format version 4.3, see details below)
from a tidy data frame.
Used internally in \href{https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator}{radiator}
and might be of interest for users.
}
\details{
\strong{VCF file format version:}

If you need a different file format version than the current one, just change
the version inside the newly created VCF, that should do the trick.
