\title{Write a \href{http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/BayeScan/}{BayeScan}
file from a tidy data frame}
\usage{
write_bayescan(
  data,
  pop.select = NULL,
  filename = NULL,
  parallel.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy data frame object in the global environment or
a tidy data frame in wide or long format in the working directory.
\emph{How to get a tidy data frame ?}
Look into \pkg{radiator} \code{\link{tidy_genomic_data}}.}

\item{pop.select}{(optional, string) Selected list of populations for
the analysis. e.g. \code{pop.select = c("QUE", "ONT")} to select \code{QUE}
and \code{ONT} population samples (out of 20 pops). If \code{pop.labels}
argument was used to rename the strata column, use the new names with
\code{pop.select}.
Default: \code{pop.select = NULL}}

\item{filename}{(optional) The file name prefix for the bayescan file
written to the working directory. With default: \code{filename = NULL},
the date and time is appended to \code{radiator_bayescan_}.}

\item{parallel.core}{(optional) The number of core used for parallel
execution during import.
Default: \code{parallel.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1}.}

\item{...}{(optional) To pass further arguments for fine-tuning the function.}
}
\value{
A bayescan file is written in the working directory.

\description{
Write a \href{http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/BayeScan/}{BayeScan}
file from a tidy data frame. The data is bi- or multi-allelic.
Used internally in \href{https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator}{radiator}
and might be of interest for users.
}
\details{
\emph{Integrated filters:}
\enumerate{
\item by defaults only markers found in common between populations are used
\item by defaults monomorphic markers are automatically removed before
generating the dataset.
